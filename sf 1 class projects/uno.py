'''
creating parts of the main deck
A card is a list with a tuple and a string EX. [('green', '4'), 'green' ].
first = green / second = 4 / third = green
The first and second elements are the colour and rank of the card.
The third element is the colour that can be played un top of that card. I.E
when we play a wild card, we must change the colour in the game without changing the card it's self
