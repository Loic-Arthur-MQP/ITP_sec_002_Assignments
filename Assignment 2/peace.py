"""
WAR is played with two players using a standard 52-card deck. The deck is divided equally, with each player receiving 26

Gameplay:
Both players simultaneously reveal the top card of their pile.
The player with the higher card takes both cards and places them at the bottom of their stack.
If the cards are of equal value, WAR is declared. Each player places three face-down cards followed by one face-up card.
The player with the higher face-up card wins all the cards in the battle.

Winning:
The game continues until one player has collected all the cards.
The game can also end after a predetermined number of battles, and the player with the most cards wins
(Instructor note : "Ensure that the game continues until one player wins all the cards" (Course website).)
